## Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

##For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.


def find_max(arr):
    a = 0
    b = 0
    
    for i in arr:
        new_b = b if b>a else a
        
        a = b + i
        b = new_b
    return (b if b>a else a)

##Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. 
##In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array.
##The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

def find_missing_positive(arr):
    lowest = arr[0]
    count = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        current = arr[i]
        count += 1
        if current < lowest:
            lowest = current
            position = count
    print('Location is ' + str(position) + ' and the number is ' + str(lowest))   ## May use return too.
       
##arr = [3,5,1,2,0,-1,4]
##find_missing_positive(arr)
